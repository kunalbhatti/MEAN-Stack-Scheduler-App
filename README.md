Technology Used: MEAN Stack + Bootstrap 4

Deployment: Heroku

Inspiration behind the project:

I wanted to build an app which looks and fels just like a mobile app using bootstrap and angular animations.

Features Added:

Manage Tasks: The app allows the user to schedule tasks. The user can perform CRUD operations on these entries. 
The entries added are always arranged in an ascending order

Monthly View: Using monthly view the user can view all the entries for the month. The user is free to view and manage 
entries from other months.

Daily View: The daily view just lists the tasks for the day. One specific feature I added in the daily view is the highlighting 
of time period. So for each hour the app will highlight the tasks. It is a UX feature that also improves the overall experience of the application
